Artificial intelligence is where we are headed to. Our goal is to build intelligent machinery or software that not only free us from heavy and dangerous labors, but also don't require detailed intructions to make every single decision, i.e. they can make the "intelligent" decisions that benefit human. But how do we create A.I.? Machine learning is one of the tools we use to create A.I. And that's where we/I'll begin.

## Goal of first week

Understand how Machine Learning works from a high level. As it turns out, to do ML well, it requires a deep understanding of Linear Algebra. So I've bundled these two topics in the first week.

### Introduction to Machine Learning + Neural Networks

The first
